def: "Staining with an aqueous or alcoholic solution of eosin Y,colors eosinophilic structures in various shades of red, pink and orange. The eosinophilic structures are generally composed of intracellular or extracellular protein. The Lewy bodies and Mallory bodies are examples of eosinophilic structures. Most of the cytoplasm is eosinophilic. Red blood cells are stained intensely red." [Wikipedia:http\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%26E_stain]

def: "The staining method involves application of hemalum, which is a complex formed from aluminium ions and oxidized haematoxylin. This colors nuclei of cells (and a few other objects, such as keratohyalin granules) blue. The staining of nuclei by hemalum does not require the presence of DNA and is probably due to binding of the dye-metal complex to arginine-rich basic nucleoproteins such as histones. The mechanism is different from that of nuclear staining by basic (cationic) dyes such as thionine or toluidine blue. Staining by basic dyes is prevented by chemical or enzymatic extraction of nucleic acids. Such extractions do not prevent staining of nuclei by hemalum."
